# Maze Generator - Pygame

A simple way to generate a maze and display it using Python with Pygame.

## How To Use

### 1. Clone the respository

To clone this repoistory using Git, use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nolannC/maze-generator.git
```

If you aren't familiar with Git, go to the top-left of this page and find the green button nammed "Clone or download". Clicking this and then click "Download ZIP". Extract the contents of the downloaded .zip file.

Open a terminal session and navigate to this folder, using `cd`.

```bash
cd maze-generator
```

### 2. Installing dependencies

We will be installing dependencies using `pip`, the official Python package manager. If you do not have `pip`, I'd recommend checking this [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6587507/how-to-install-pip-with-python-3/) to install it.

Copy, paste and run the following line in your terminal session to install all necessary packages.

```bash
pip3 install pygame
```

### 3. Running

Running this script is straightforward. Simply run in your terminal session:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

If all goes well, you should see a maze being generated.

## Done !
